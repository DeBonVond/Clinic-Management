# health-clinic-administration-apps

This is a web application that simply register any patients that comes to My Mother's Clinic.
Yes, my Mom is a Doctor, who have inhouse-clinic for public. 
This apps was created because of lately My mother just confuse about her "patients-databases" which has increase in time by time.
This was confused cause its databases is still use paper-based, which is required a bunch of space to be placed. 
Yes, I means a "bunch of place" cause it's consist of almost 10 boxes of paper now.
Another problem is.. its required a huge effort once we need to search the database of the person when its needed.

So I thought that it must be simply digitalized, then I decided to create this application to solve My Lovely Mom problem.

Features:
There are two main data that addressed in this database: 
1) Personal Data (name, age, address, etc) & (2) Medical Record (diagnose, therapy, date).
This Application also has "Antrian" feature, that can manage patients who comes to My mother clinic to queue them in order 
base on their arrival.

This Apps mainly build by React and Redux platform, also with:
- Webpack
- Npm scripts
- Npm Package Manager
- CSS
- HTML
- ES6
- Bootstrap
